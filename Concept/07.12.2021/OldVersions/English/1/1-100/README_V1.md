# URLL File specification

## July 12th 2021 concept

### Description

URLL file

Stands for: URL List

A shortcut file that contains multiple shortcuts

### Syntax

Very simple syntax, just copy and paste the links into the document, 1 link per line. It will ignore whitespace and find each link

You can also write the syntax similar to that of a regular URL file, but as a list. Both syntax modes are allowed

Opens like this:

> [You have opened a list of URLs. Which one would you like to open first?]

<listing, all entries>

Once the first one is opened, the dialogue changes to:

> [You have opened a list of URLs. Which one would you like to open next?]

<listing, still all entries, purple for ones opened>
