Installing the URLL Specification repository
----

This project currently does not have to be installed. It is just a set of documentation, and some tools for the URLL file specification.

It is recommended to have a markdown viewer installed, as there are lots of markdown files.

Some libraries are included, and are written in multiple languages each. Try to have Python 3.7.1 or later installed to get at least one variant of the library working.
