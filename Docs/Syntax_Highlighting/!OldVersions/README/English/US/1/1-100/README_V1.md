# Syntax highlighting

Currently, any programming language that uses `--` for commenting is syntax compatible with the URLL file extension for all features, except for links.

Notable programming languages include:

- [x] Elm
- [x] VHDL
- [x] Lua
- [x] MoonScript
- [x] Ada
- [x] AppleScript
- [x] Haskell
- [x] SQL
- [x] Eiffel
- [x] Forth
- [x] NetRexx
- [x] Apache Piglatin
- [x] PlPGSQL
- [x] TSQL

This list is incomplete.

***

## Examples

```elm
-- This is what a comment looks
```

```elm
--URLL-version=2;
-- This is what a shebang looks like
```

Elm syntax highlighting is being used in place of URLL syntax highlighting, as the language isn't notable enough to be recognized by GitHub yet.
