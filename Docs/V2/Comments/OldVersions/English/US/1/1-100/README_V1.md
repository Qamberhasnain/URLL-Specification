# URLL Comments

Comments are a new feature in URLL V2.x and beyond. They are only available in `.urll` files that have a [shebang](/Docs/V2/Shebang/)

Single line comments go as followed:

```urll
-- An example website
https://www.example.com/
```

Multi-line (block comments) are written like this:

```urll
--\
This is a multi-line
block comment
--/
```

Comment syntax is in use for all non-links in a `.urll` file.
