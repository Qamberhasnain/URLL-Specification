# Spread the URLL format

```markdown
if you can, please help me spread the adoption of the URLL list file by using it in your project.
It is best used for storing 2 or more links in a list, although it can be used for storing single links.
Its main benefit over the typical `.*url` or `*.lnk` files is that it is plain text, cross-platform, and can store multiple links, and doesn't require a strict syntax, so it is easy to learn.
It is not officially recognized by GitHub yet, but I hope for it to be in the future.
Visit the project for more info.
